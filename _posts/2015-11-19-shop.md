description: 'Why a seedling is better than a clone: A seedling is a unique plant that no one else can own unless it is cloned. This is a great opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind seedling hybridized by Dr. Motes. All were produced from Motes Orchids breeding collection selected for the finest floral quality over 50 years.'
